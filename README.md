# AudioBook
In this project, I have covered the implementation of a basic audiobook, that can read the entire pdf book using a few lines of python code.
For better audio results you can also tune the voice, rate, and volume of the speaker library.
The end audio result of the audiobook is not that good, as the text needs some preprocessing before feeding to the speaker engine
